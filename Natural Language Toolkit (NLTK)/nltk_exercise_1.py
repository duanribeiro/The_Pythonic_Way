# DATA PREPROCESSING (Pág. 47)
# We have two basic strategies to deal words from the same root: stemming and lemmatization.
# Stemming is the more quick and dirty type approach. It involves chopping and the result of stemming doesn't have to be a valid word.
# Lemmatizing, on the other hand, is slower but more accurate. Performs a dictionary lookup and guarantees to return a valid word.

# Let's reuse the code from the previous section to get the 500 words with highest counts, but this time, we will apply filtering:
def letters_only(astr):
    return astr.isalpha()
